- Secure naming and service identity using X.509 certificates
    - Need to dig down further, sounds interesting
- Istio authorization provides service to service level RBAC, so as to prevent unauthorized access and communication
    - What????
- Istio network policies are enforced at the pod level (at layer 7) making it possible to enforce policy at the protocol level (for example, based on some HTTP headers)
- We can actually validate JWT token!

# Some theory:

# Basic
- SSL Handshake:
  - Client initiates a client hello to server where it specifies
    - The highest TLS it supports.
    - A random number
    - Ciphers stuit supported by client
    - Compression Methods supported by client
    - Session ID
  - Server (responds with)
    - Choose TLS method as per the highest TLS supported by the client.
    - A random number
    - Choose cipher from the options offered by client
    - Choose compression method
  - Then server sends it's TLS certificate for client to validate(With MTLS in this same request, server will request client to send it's certificate for validation purpose)
  - Client validates server certificate by talking to CA server. If successful, client sends it's own certificate to server.
  - Server validates client's certificate in the same way.
  - Then they both use symmetric key for communication.

# TLS vs mTLS Comparison

This document provides a comparison between TLS (Transport Layer Security) and mTLS (Mutual TLS) with an outline of the steps involved in both protocols.

| **Step** | **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** | **mTLS (Mutual TLS)** |
|----------|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Client Hello** | Client sends a "Client Hello" message to the server, indicating support for certain encryption algorithms and the TLS version. | Same as TLS: Client sends a "Client Hello" message to the server. |
| **2. Server Hello** | Server responds with a "Server Hello" message, choosing encryption algorithms and sending its digital certificate (including its public key). | Same as TLS: Server responds with a "Server Hello" message, sending its certificate. |
| **3. Server Certificate** | Server sends its certificate to the client. This certificate contains the server's public key. | Same as TLS: Server sends its certificate to the client. |
| **4. Server Key Exchange (if necessary)** | Server might send a key exchange message if the chosen encryption requires it. | Same as TLS: Server might send a key exchange message. |
| **5. Certificate Request (optional)** | Server might request the client’s certificate for authentication (not common in regular TLS). | In mTLS, the server requests the client's certificate to authenticate the client. This is mandatory in mTLS. |
| **6. Client Certificate** | Not applicable in standard TLS unless client authentication is required. The client does not usually send a certificate. | The client sends its certificate to the server, authenticating itself to the server. |
| **7. Client Key Exchange** | Client generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it with the server’s public key, and sends it to the server. | Same as TLS: Client generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it with the server’s public key, and sends it to the server. |
| **8. Certificate Verify** | Not applicable unless client authentication is requested by the server. | The client signs a piece of data with its private key to prove ownership of the certificate. The server verifies this signature. |
| **9. Session Key Generation** | Both client and server generate session keys from the pre-master secret, which will be used to encrypt the rest of the communication. | Same as TLS: Both client and server generate session keys. |
| **10. Finished Messages** | Both client and server send "Finished" messages encrypted with the session key to confirm that the handshake was successful and that they can now communicate securely. | Same as TLS: Both client and server exchange "Finished" messages. |
| **11. Encrypted Data Exchange** | The client and server exchange encrypted messages using the session key. Only the server is authenticated. | Both parties exchange encrypted messages using the session key. Both the client and server are authenticated. |

### Key Differences in mTLS:
- **Client Authentication**: In mTLS, both the client and the server present certificates to authenticate each other, ensuring that both parties are trusted. In TLS, only the server is typically authenticated.
- **Security Level**: mTLS provides an additional layer of security by ensuring that both the client and the server are who they claim to be.

- jwksUri: https://dev-dcaw1vncocip3kwe.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json
- curl --request POST \
  --url https://dev-dcaw1vncocip3kwe.us.auth0.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
