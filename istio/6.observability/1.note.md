- Logging, metrics , tracing - good diagnosability triangle.
- istioctl manifest apply --set profile=demo `installs prometheus which we need for observability`
- ***VVI*** istio service mesh automatically collects tons of metrics and send them to prometheus!!! WOW! So, with a open source grafana, prometheus and loki helm chart everything preconfigured, just pull istio metrics combined with other available in that stack will make really powerful ovserability dashboard. Definitely, worths a POC. Let's not forget our good friend OTEL.
- *VVI* 
    - Grafana , prometheus and Loki - these 3 are next to study for devops study.
    - Prometheus is the most interesting and challenging one. 
    - Loki is the second
    - OTEL third
    - Grafana last as I always dislike building visuals. I wish someone else with better UX skill would help me(aka my wife :p)

# Install prometheus and config for istio:
